A suggestion CLI, which helps with daily decision-making by providing a selected list of doings based on your schedule. Built for repeatable doings from 1 day to 1 month (possible to extend, but you probably need something else for such cases).

## Key Ideas

- Centric only around suggestions, it's totally up to you to decide what to do.
- Trusts you, so it doesn't track your doings by preserving you do your best.
- Built mainly to check the concept.
